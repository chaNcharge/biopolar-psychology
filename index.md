## At a glance
Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania/hypomania) and lows (depression). Hypomania is considered to be less severe than mania, but still shows the same symptoms. It is a fairly common disorder, with more than 3 million US cases per year.

## Symptoms
Symptoms in highs include sudden energy, reduced need for sleep, and disconnection from reality. In lows, symptoms include low energy, low motivation, or irritability. However, symptoms vary in different people. There are several types of bipolar disorder. They include mania or hypomania and depression. The symptoms can cause unpredictable fluctuations in mood and behavior, which can lead to prolonged stress and difficulties in life. Symptoms usually start to show in in teens.
- **Bipolar I disorder**: Had at least one mania/hypomania followed or preceded by depression. May sometimes trigger disconnection from reality, also known as psychosis.
- **Bipolar II disorder**: Had at least one major depressive and hypomanic episode, but never a manic episode.
- **Cyclothymic disorder**: Had at least 2 years (1 year in teens and children) of hypomania and depressive symptoms.
- **Others**: Includes when the disorder is induced by certain drugs or alcohol due to a medical condition, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis

## Treatments
The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but genetics and biological differences in the brain may be involved.

Treatments can help reduce symptoms, but this condition cannot be completely cured.

Treatments include:
- **Therapy**: Support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other kinds of therapy can help reduce symptoms
- **Medications**: Anticonvulsant, Antipsychotic, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) 
- **Hospitalization**

There isn't a sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. Avoiding drugs and alcohol, paying attention to warning signs, and taking medications exactly as directed can keep the disorder under control. If you haven't been diagnosed yet and are seeing symptoms and warning signs, see a psychiatrist or call 911 if it gets out of hand.

## History
The symptoms of bipolar disorder were noticed as early as the first century in Greece, but it wasn't acknowledged for a long time. In the 17th century, Theophilus Bonet published work titled *Sepuchretum*, where he linked mania and melancholy in a condition called "manico-melancolicus". At first, mania and depression were often considered separate disorders. Over time, scientists noticed they cycle between mania and depression, and called it circular insanity. They also noted a genetic connection. A scientist named Emil Kraepelin recognized biological causes of mental illnesses, rather than society and other suprressed desires causing mental illnesses. The term first appeared in the DSM-3 in 1980, which took away using the term “maniacs” to describe people with this disorder.

## Stigma
Some think people with bipolar are dangerous and extremely moody. In the past, people thought they were maniacs who should be in an asylum. Because of this, people with the disorder have a much harder time speaking out about it than what the actual disorder is doing to them. People with bipolar disorder aren't dangerous, they can't help themselves! If you're reading this and you have a friend that has bipolar, don't be afraid of them! If you talk to each other, that can help make their day a lot better. If you have the disorder and you're reading this, don't be afraid of others! Don't be afraid to speak out about it to your friends!
